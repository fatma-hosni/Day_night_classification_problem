  ### install python modules using command line tool called pip 
      pip is already installed if you are using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from python.org or if you are working in a Virtual Environment created by virtualenv       or venv. Just make sure to upgrade pip.
   ## Step 1: Check if PIP is Already Installed
        Type in the following command at the command prompt:
        
        pip help
   ## Step 2: Verify Python Installation
    To determine whether you have Python installed:
        -  Open the Command Prompt window.
        -  When the console window opens, type in:
           python
   ## Installing PIP On Windows:
   ### Download PIP get-pip.py
        - Before installing PIP, download the get-pip.py file:https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
          Download the file to the desired folder in Windows. You can save the file to any location, but remember the path so you can use it later.
        - check version again
   ## cd to requirement.txt path and run this command line:
        pip install -r requirement.txt
